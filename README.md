Q-Learning Algorithm in Python
This repository contains an implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm, one of the fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms used for solving Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems. The algorithm is designed to help an agent learn the optimal policy to maximize cumulative rewards in an environment through trial and error.

Introduction
Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the best action to take given the current state. It uses Q-values (also known as action-value function) to represent the value of taking a certain action from a given state. Through iterative updates, the agent learns the optimal action-selection policy to maximize its expected cumulative reward.

This Python implementation includes:

A basic environment for testing the Q-Learning algorithm.
A Q-Learning agent capable of exploring and exploiting actions.
Example simulation scripts to demonstrate the learning process.
How Q-Learning Works
Q-Learning is based on the following update rule:

𝑄
(
𝑠
,
𝑎
)
=
𝑄
(
𝑠
,
𝑎
)
+
𝛼
[
𝑟

𝛾

𝑄

)

𝑄

]
Q(s,a)=Q(s,a)+α[r+γ 
a 
′
 
max
​
 Q(s 
′
 ,a 
′
 )−Q(s,a)]
Where:

𝑄
(
𝑠
,
𝑎
)
Q(s,a) is the Q-value for state s and action a.
𝛼
α is the learning rate.
𝑟
r is the reward received after taking action a.
𝛾
γ is the discount factor (how much we value future rewards).
max
⁡
𝑎

)
max 
a

​
 Q(s 
′
 ,a 
′
 ) is the maximum Q-value for the next state s'.
The agent updates its Q-values based on the above formula as it explores the environment.

Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

numpy
matplotlib (optional for visualizations)
gym (optional for integration with OpenAI Gym environments)
You can install the required dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/q-learning-python.git
cd q-learning-python
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
You can train the Q-Learning agent by running the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
python q_learning.py
By default, the script will simulate the agent's learning process in a simple grid-world environment. You can modify the environment or parameters such as the learning rate (alpha), discount factor (gamma), and exploration strategy (epsilon) directly in the script.

Example
Below is a simple example of how the agent interacts with the environment and learns to maximize its rewards.

python
Copy code
from q_learning import QLearningAgent
from environment import GridWorldEnv

env = GridWorldEnv()
agent = QLearningAgent(alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.1)

episodes = 1000
for episode in range(episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        action = agent.choose_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state
You can modify this script to implement other environments, like those from OpenAI Gym.

Future Improvements
Add support for more complex environments (e.g., OpenAI Gym environments like CartPole).
Implement Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with neural networks for function approximation.
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time visualization of the agent's learning process.
